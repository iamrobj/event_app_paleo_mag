## Section 3 ##
section_3_title: See whose speaking
section_3_text: How often do you visit an events website to see who's speaking & read their bio?  Never?  Us neither.  However we would like to take a look just as a talk is about to start, if only we could do it this easily..

## Section 4 ##
section_4_title: Custom Schedule
section_4_text: You know how you normally find a pen, get the paper schedule, circle the talks you want to see & then keep checking it every hour to make sure you don't miss out on one?  Yeah, don't do that.  Create your own custom schedule in the app & get reminders when a talk is about to start.
